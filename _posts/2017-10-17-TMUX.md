# Handling Terminal
## New terminal
```
$ tmux new -s ${NAME}
```

## Reattach Terminal
```
$ tmux a -s ${NAME}
```

## Scrolling 
Ctrl-b then [ then you can use your normal navigation keys to scroll around (eg.
Up Arrow or PgDn). Press q to quit scroll mode.

## Shortcut Reference

Now a Ctrl-b options reference:

## Basics
```
    ? get help
```
## Session management
```
    s list sessions
    $ rename the current session
    d detach from the current session
```

## Windows
```
    c create a new window
    , rename the current window
    w list windows
    % split horizontally
    " split vertically
    n change to the next window
    p change to the previous window
    0 to 9 select windows 0 through 9
```

## Panes
```
    % create a horizontal pane
    " create a vertical pane
    h move to the left pane. *
    j move to the pane below *
    l move to the right pane *
    k move to the pane above *
    k move to the pane above *
    q show pane numbers
    o toggle between panes
    } swap with next pane
    { swap with previous pane
    ! break the pane out of the window
    x kill the current pane
```

## Miscellaneous
```
    t show the time in current pane
```

## Resizing Panes

You can also resize panes if you don’t like the layout defaults. I personally
rarely need to do this, though it’s handy to know how. Here is the basic syntax
to resize panes:

```
PREFIX : resize-pane -D (Resizes the current pane down)
PREFIX : resize-pane -U (Resizes the current pane upward)
PREFIX : resize-pane -L (Resizes the current pane left)
PREFIX : resize-pane -R (Resizes the current pane right)
PREFIX : resize-pane -D 20 (Resizes the current pane down by 20 cells)
PREFIX : resize-pane -U 20 (Resizes the current pane upward by 20 cells)
PREFIX : resize-pane -L 20 (Resizes the current pane left by 20 cells)
PREFIX : resize-pane -R 20 (Resizes the current pane right by 20 cells)
PREFIX : resize-pane -t 2 20 (Resizes the pane with the id of 2 down by 20
cells)
PREFIX : resize-pane -t -L 20 (Resizes the pane with the id of 2 left by 20
cells)
```
